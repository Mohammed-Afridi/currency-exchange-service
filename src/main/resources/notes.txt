here we are creating a new rest api for currency exchange service

Now will look at load balancing
                                    currency conversion microservice
                                                ||
                                           Load Balancer
                                                ||
Currency Exchange-Instance 1   Currency Exchange-Instance 2   Currency Exchange-Instance 3

When I call currency conversion ms, I'd need to know which instance I am calling

when i run this now , http://localhost:8000/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR , I get
{
  "id": 1000,
  "from": "USD",
  "to": "INR",
  "conversionMultiple": 50,
  "environment": "8000"
}
