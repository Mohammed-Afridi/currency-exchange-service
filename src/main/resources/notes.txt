here we are creating a new rest api for currency exchange service

Now will look at load balancing
                                    currency conversion microservice
                                                ||
                                           Load Balancer
                                                ||
Currency Exchange-Instance 1   Currency Exchange-Instance 2   Currency Exchange-Instance 3

When I call currency conversion ms, I'd need to know which instance I am calling
